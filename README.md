Projects Name:  Four Way Traffic Light Light Controller

The project focuses on a 4 ways traffic light controller system using a 555 timer IC and counter IC CD4017. 
Traffic control is crucial for transportation and conducts road signals for automobiles. 
The lights control vehicle movement through color signals, with red lights for stopping, 
yellow for slowing down, and green for going ahead. Traffic signals have been used since 1868 
to prevent road accidents and bottlenecks. The project aims to develop a discrete crossroad traffic 
signaling system using a 555 timer IC, addressing various flaws and enhancing traffic management. 
The goal is to create a simple, affordable, and real-time smart traffic light control system.

Objective
1. To monitor and control traffic and automobiles on roadways having 
massive traffic levels.
2.By giving the proper signals to different directions for a set period of time, 
avoid car accidents and ensure driver safety.
3. Optimizing Traffic Flow and decrease interruptions.
4. Reducing Congestion and Travel Time.
5. Enhancing Pedestrian and Cyclist Safety.
6. Sustainability and Environmental Impact.
7. To increase vehicle safety and environmental advantages.
